			<h3>Goal</h3>
			The goal is to get the field cleared by removing all of the blocks from the field.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>How to</h3>
			To remove (better: To check whether a removal is valid) a block you have to click on it.<br />
			If you think you made a mistake, just undo your last action.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Rules</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>After clicking on a colored block and the move is valid, all of the adjacent blocks of the same color are being removed</li>
				<li>Empty fields are being filled up with blocks from the top ('falling down')</li>
				<li>After 'falling down' the blocks shift to empty fields to the left side ('shift left')</li>
				<li>The game is over when there are no more blocks left or the player does not have any valid remaining moves</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Game modes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Easy</i>: Blocks are removed vertically, horizontally and diagonally</li>
				<li><i>Normal</i>: Blocks are removed vertically and horizontally</li>
				<li><i>Harder</i>: Select more colors and/or more fields to make the game harder</li>
			</ul>
